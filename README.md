### todo-app

I prepared this simple ToDo app in .NET Core 5.0 MVC due to understand and practice some of the subjects in my .Net Core training. 

## What I learned when I prepare this project?

- [x] SOLID principles
- [x] N Tier Architecture
- [x] Unit of Work
- [x] How to use AutoMapper
- [x] FluentValidation


I will continue to update this project after finish my training.
